    'FAQ answer 1' => 'The psychologist works individually with each client, fully immersing himself in his
                                problem. Therefore, the results are always different - they can be both positive and
                                negative. Everyone has their own life situation, and the process of therapy is different
                                for everyone. The specialist who successfully helped your friend may be incompetent in
                                your case. Choosing the best psychologist based on your specific situation and needs is
                                an individual process.',
